=======================

because LTspice projects deserve version control too!

###Things we've got
* Custom symbols
* CurrentStarvedInverter (now with 0% sadness?! we think.)
* Ring oscillator from inverter
* Kessler's op amp things might have some sadness though

###Things we need
* 100% less sadness
* Way to clean output (Schmitt Trigger?)
* Tanable frequencies
* Export output to matlab
* Music!
