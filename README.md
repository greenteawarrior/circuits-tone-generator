=======================

because LTspice projects deserve version control too!

###Things we've got
* Custom symbols
* CurrentStarvedInverter (but with 10% sadness)

###Things we need
* 100% less sadness
* Ring oscillator from inverter
* Way to clean output (Schmitt Trigger?)
* Tanable frequencies
* Export output to matlab
* Music!
